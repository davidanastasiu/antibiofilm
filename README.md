Summary: In this work, we developed machine learning models to identify the distinguishing characteristics
of known antibiofilm peptides, and to mine peptide databases from diverse habitats to classify new peptides
with potential antibiofilm activities. Additionally, we used the reported minimum inhibitory/eradication
concentration (MBIC/MBEC) of the antibiofilm peptides to create a regression model on top of the classification
model to predict the effectiveness of new antibiofilm peptides. We used a positive dataset containing 242
antibiofilm peptides, and a negative dataset which, unlike previous datasets, contains peptides that are 
likely to promote biofilm formation. We utilized our classification-regression pipeline to evaluate 135,015 
peptides from diverse sources and identified antibiofilm peptide candidates that are efficacious against 
preformed biofilms at micromolar concentration.
